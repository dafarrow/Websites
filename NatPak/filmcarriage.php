        <h2>Dual Roll Carriage</h2>
 </div>
      <p> Designed for the toughest applications the Phoenix Dual Film Carriage System applies two layers of film using very high
        film tension. The result is an ultra-strong wrap applied in less time and with less film than with traditional pre-stretch heads.
</p>

     <div style="text-align: center;"><img style="width: 420px; height: 300px;" alt="" src="image/DualCarriage1.png"></div>
    <p> The system's exceptional performance results from the unique treatment of the layers before they are applied
      to the load. The first film layer is sliced and roped into three nearly indestructible bands while the second layer of film is kept
      as a full web. The two layers are prestretched simultaneously bonding them into a single layer of film
      with extraordinary properties.</p>
      <h3> Available for new machines and as a retrofit</h3>
      <p> The Phoenix Dual Film Carriage system is available as an option on all new Phoenix stretch machines. National Packaging Equipment and Service can also
        make the head available as a retrofit for existing equipment or convert your existing carriage with the dual carriage components.
